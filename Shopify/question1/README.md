# Sneaker shops analysis

This project is a part 1 of Shopify Fall 2022 Data Science Intern Challenge.

Given sample data `shopify_challange_1.csv`, write a program to answer the following:


>On Shopify, we have exactly 100 sneaker shops, and each of these shops sells only one model of shoe. We want to do some analysis of the average order value (AOV). When we look at orders data over a 30 day window, we naively calculate an AOV of $3145.13. Given that we know these shops are selling sneakers, a relatively affordable item, something seems wrong with our analysis. 

1. Think about what could be going wrong with our calculation. Think about a better way to evaluate this data. 
2. What metric would you report for this dataset?
3. What is its value?



In this project given data was cleaned out from outliers. 

Next we explored summary statistics, like average, min and max of order amount, total items in one order, as well as item price.

Other than that, we explored destribution of total order values, total order count and total ordered pairs of shoes by store.

Lastly we found customers, who ordered maximum pairs and spent maximum amount on sneakers in 30 days period and compared that to average.
