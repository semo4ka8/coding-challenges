# Doubly linked list

Doubly linked list is a sequential chain of nodes.

In this project we:

+ Add a new node to the head (beginning) of the list
+ Add a new node to the tail (end) of the list
+ Remove a node from the head of the list
+ Remove a node from the tail of the list
+ Find and remove a specific node by its value
+ Print out the nodes in the list in order from head to tail
